# Reactive Programming Publisher-Subscriber Demo

## Project Overview

This project serves as a learning tool and a reference implementation for understanding reactive programming patterns.

## Concepts Overview

### Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

The publisher-subscriber pattern is a fundamental concept in reactive programming where:

-   **Publisher**: A source of data that can emit multiple values over time
-   **Subscriber**: A consumer that receives and processes the data emitted by the publisher
-   **Subscription**: The connection between a publisher and subscriber that manages the flow of data

### Key Benefits

-   **Asynchronous Processing**: Publishers and subscribers can operate independently
-   **Backpressure Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle different processing speeds
-   **Non-blocking Operations**: Efficient handling of data streams without blocking threads
-   **Composable Operations**: Easy to combine and transform data streams

### Common Use Cases

-   Real-time data processing
-   Event-driven architectures
-   Stream processing
-   Asynchronous data handling
-   Reactive user interfaces
